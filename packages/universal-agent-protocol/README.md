# Universal Agent Protocol (UAP)

The Universal Agent Protocol defines the standard interface for all AI agents to integrate with the CRM platform. This protocol enables seamless discovery, installation, and operation of AI agents from any provider.

## Overview

UAP is the foundation of our platform strategy, transforming the CRM from a single application into an ecosystem where AI agents can:
- Be discovered and installed with one click
- Operate securely within sandboxed environments  
- Access CRM data with granular permissions
- Provide native UI components
- Bill based on usage

## Core Principles

1. **Security First** - All agents run in isolated sandboxes with explicit permissions
2. **Developer Experience** - Simple, well-documented APIs with TypeScript support
3. **User Experience** - Native integration that feels built-in, not bolted-on
4. **Performance** - Efficient event-driven architecture with minimal overhead
5. **Flexibility** - Support diverse agent types (voice, chat, data enrichment, etc.)

## Protocol Components

### 1. Agent Manifest
Describes the agent's capabilities, requirements, and metadata.

### 2. Lifecycle Interface
Manages agent installation, startup, shutdown, and removal.

### 3. Data Interface
Handles bidirectional data flow between CRM and agents.

### 4. UI Integration
Allows agents to provide native UI components.

### 5. Event System
Real-time communication via event streams.

### 6. Permission Model
Granular access control for CRM resources.

## Quick Start

```typescript
import { UniversalAgentAdapter, AgentManifest } from '@crm-platform/uap';

class MyAgent implements UniversalAgentAdapter {
  getManifest(): AgentManifest {
    return {
      name: 'My Awesome Agent',
      version: '1.0.0',
      provider: 'My Company',
      description: 'An AI agent that does awesome things',
      capabilities: ['whatsapp', 'lead-scoring'],
      permissions: ['contacts:read', 'messages:write'],
      pricing: { model: 'usage-based', rate: 0.01 }
    };
  }
  
  async connect(): Promise<void> {
    // Initialize your agent
  }
  
  // ... implement other required methods
}
```
