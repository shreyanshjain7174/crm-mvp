## Project Overview

**Progressive Disclosure CRM for Indian SMEs** - A no-code, self-discovering customer relationship management platform that starts completely blank and progressively reveals features as users achieve milestones. The system transforms from a simple contact manager to a full AI-powered CRM through natural user progression.

### Design Philosophy
1. **Start with Zero**: Blank dashboard, single CTA - no overwhelming features
2. **Reveal on Achievement**: Features unlock based on user actions and milestones
3. **No Training Required**: Context-sensitive hints and natural discovery patterns
4. **Progressive Complexity**: Contact Manager â†’ WhatsApp Hub â†’ AI Assistant â†’ Full CRM

### Target User Journey
- **Minute 1-5**: Add first contact â†’ unlock contact list
- **Minute 5-30**: Send first WhatsApp â†’ unlock chat interface
- **Day 1-3**: 10+ contacts â†’ unlock pipeline and organization tools
- **Week 1**: 50+ messages â†’ unlock AI assistant
- **Week 2+**: 10+ AI approvals â†’ unlock automation and advanced agents

## Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ with App Router and TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/ui components
- **State**: Zustand for client state, React Query for server state

### AI Agent System
- **Orchestration**: LangChain for agent coordination
- **Specialized Agents**:
  - Lead Qualification Agent
  - Message Generation Agent  
  - Follow-up Scheduler Agent
  - Intent Recognition Agent
  - Context Memory Agent
- **LLM Provider**: OpenAI GPT-4o (primary), Gemini (fallback)
- **Vector Store**: Pinecone for chat embeddings and RAG

2. **User Journey Optimization**: A/B test unlock triggers and timings
3. **Onboarding Experience**: Create seamless first-time user flow
4. **Achievement System**: Gamify user progression with celebrations
5. **Analytics Integration**: Track user progression and feature adoption

## Animation and Interaction Patterns

### Visual Design Guidelines
**Inspiration**: Linear, Notion, Superhuman - clean, minimal with delightful micro-interactions
**Reference**: https://jitter.video/templates/ui-elements/ (subtle, professional animations)

### Animation Types
1. **Feature Reveal**: Fade in with subtle upward motion (300ms ease-out)
2. **Achievement Celebrations**: Confetti or subtle particle effects (800ms)
3. **Progress Indicators**: Smooth progress bars with milestone markers
4. **Contextual Tooltips**: Slide in from appropriate direction (200ms)
5. **Empty States**: Gentle breathing/pulse animations (2s loop)
6. **Loading States**: Skeleton screens with shimmer effects
7. **Micro-interactions**: Button hover, click feedback, form validation

### Interaction Patterns
```typescript
// Animation configuration
const ANIMATIONS = {
  featureReveal: {
    initial: { opacity: 0, y: 20 },
    animate: { opacity: 1, y: 0 },
    transition: { duration: 0.3, ease: 'easeOut' }
  },
  achievement: {
    initial: { scale: 0.8, opacity: 0 },
    animate: { scale: 1, opacity: 1 },
    exit: { scale: 0.9, opacity: 0 },
    transition: { duration: 0.5, ease: 'easeInOut' }
  },
  contextualHint: {
    initial: { opacity: 0, x: -10 },
    animate: { opacity: 1, x: 0 },
    transition: { duration: 0.2, ease: 'easeOut' }
  }
}
```

### Progressive UI Principles
1. **Minimalism First**: Start with single CTA, add complexity gradually
2. **Contextual Relevance**: Show features only when needed
3. **Natural Progression**: Each unlock should feel earned and timely
4. **Celebration Moments**: Acknowledge user achievements meaningfully
5. **Gentle Guidance**: Hints appear naturally, not intrusively
6. **Consistent Patterns**: Maintain design language across all stages

### No-Code Interface Elements
1. **Drag-and-Drop Builders**: Visual template creation
2. **If-This-Then-That Rules**: Simple automation setup
3. **Visual Workflow Designer**: Flowchart-style process builder
4. **Template Library**: Pre-built components with customization
5. **Smart Suggestions**: AI-powered recommendations based on usage

## Success Metrics and Testing

## Deployment Strategy Notes

- For now other than the sensitive information push the changes in the main branch, after this point we will use one staging branch and the main branch will be our production branch

## Commit Guidelines
- Always use user signed commits with -s flag, never use co-authored commits
- PRs created by Claude should not contain co-authored commits
- All commits must be signed off by the user only

## GitHub Project Board Management
- Always update task status in GitHub project board using gh CLI
- Use project ID: PVT_kwHOApp2eM4A-WnZ for all project board operations
- Update item status when PRs are created, merged, or when significant progress is made
- Available statuses: Backlog, Ready, In progress, In review, Done
- Available priorities: P0 (Critical), P1 (High), P2 (Medium)
- Commands:
  ```bash
  # Add items to project
  gh project item-add 1 --owner shreyanshjain7174 --url <GITHUB_URL>
  
  # Update status
