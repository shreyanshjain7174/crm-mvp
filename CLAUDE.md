## Key Implementation Patterns

### Event-Driven Communication
All services communicate via Redis Streams events:
- `lead.created`, `lead.updated`, `lead.status_changed`
- `message.received`, `message.sent`, `message.failed`
- `ai.suggestion_generated`, `ai.action_completed`

### AI Agent Workflow
1. **Event Trigger**: Lead action or message received
2. **Context Assembly**: Gather lead history, chat logs, business profile
3. **Agent Selection**: Route to appropriate specialized agent
4. **Response Generation**: AI generates suggestions/actions
5. **Human Review**: Present to user for approval (unless auto-approved)
6. **Execution**: Send message or update lead status
7. **Learning**: Store interaction for future context

### Database Schema Patterns
- **Lead Entity**: Core lead information with status tracking
- **Message Entity**: WhatsApp messages with threading
- **Interaction Entity**: All touchpoints (calls, emails, status changes)
- **AI_Suggestion Entity**: Generated suggestions with approval status
- **Context_Memory Entity**: Embeddings for RAG retrieval

## WhatsApp Integration

### Provider Configuration
- **Primary**: 360dialog WhatsApp Business API
- **Fallback**: Twilio or Gupshup
- **Webhook**: `/api/whatsapp/webhook` for incoming messages
- **Authentication**: Bearer token with IP whitelisting

### Message Flow
1. Incoming message → chat-service webhook
2. Parse and store message
3. Trigger AI agent for response suggestion
4. Present suggestion to user in real-time UI
5. User approves/edits → send via WhatsApp API
6. Log interaction and update lead timeline

## AI Prompt Templates

### System Context Template
```
You are an AI CRM agent for {business_name}. 
Business profile: {business_profile}
Current lead: {lead_context}
Chat history: {chat_history}
Task: {specific_task}

Rules:
- Always maintain professional but friendly tone
- Use context from previous interactions
- Suggest concrete next actions
- Flag complex issues for human review
- Format WhatsApp messages appropriately
```

### Lead Qualification Agent
Analyzes lead quality, suggests categorization, and recommends priority level.

### Message Generation Agent  
Creates contextual WhatsApp responses based on lead history and business knowledge.

### Follow-up Scheduler Agent
Determines optimal follow-up timing and message content based on lead behavior patterns.
