### Key Improvements Made:
1. **Eliminated redundancy**: Removed duplicate proxy setups (proxy-server.js)
2. **Organized documentation**: Split 451-line README into focused documents
3. **Cleaner scripts**: Simplified development scripts in `/scripts/dev/`
4. **Better structure**: Clear separation of apps, packages, docs, and infrastructure
5. **Professional layout**: Industry-standard project organization

## AI Assistant Guidelines
- **Message Efficiency**: Minimize messages due to usage limits. Batch multiple operations in single responses.
- **Proactive Execution**: Complete tasks fully without asking for confirmation at each step.
- **Comprehensive Actions**: When given a task, execute all necessary steps to completion.
- **Single Response**: Combine analysis, implementation, testing, and verification in one response when possible.

### MCP Tool Usage Strategy
- **Security First**: Always run Semgrep security scans on new code before deployment
- **Research Integration**: Use Exa/Ref/DeepWiki for understanding technologies, APIs, and best practices
- **Database Safety**: Use Neon branching for safe schema changes and migrations
- **Deployment Automation**: Leverage Fly.io MCP for production deployments and monitoring
- **Quality Assurance**: Use Playwright for automated E2E testing of critical user flows
- **Documentation Discovery**: Search for implementation patterns and solutions using MCP research tools

### Proactive MCP Integration Examples
```typescript
// When implementing new features:
1. Research similar implementations using DeepWiki
2. Check security implications with Semgrep  
3. Test database changes on Neon branch
4. Validate UI changes with Playwright
5. Deploy safely to Fly.io with monitoring

// When debugging issues:
1. Search for solutions using Ref documentation
2. Analyze similar codebases with DeepWiki
3. Check for security vulnerabilities with Semgrep
4. Test fixes with browser automation
5. Deploy fixes with confidence
```

## Development Standards

### Code Quality
- Clean Architecture principles with proper separation of concerns
- TypeScript with strict type checking
- Zod schema validation for all API endpoints
- Comprehensive error handling with structured logging
- Test-driven development with meaningful test coverage

### Commit Standards (STRICT RULES)
- **MANDATORY**: Signed commits only: `git commit -s -m "type: description"`
- **MANDATORY**: Feature branches with pull requests to main - NO direct commits
- **FORBIDDEN**: AI/LLM-generated commit messages or language
- **REQUIRED**: Natural, human language - "fixed login bug" NOT "implement robust authentication mechanism"  
- **REQUIRED**: Conventional commit prefixes: feat, fix, refactor, test, docs
- **MANDATORY**: All CI checks must pass before merge
- **ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN**: Co-authored commits - only signed commits by actual developer
- **RULE**: Keep messages under 50 characters for summary line

### Architecture Principles

#### Backend (Node.js/Fastify)
- Route handlers focus solely on HTTP concerns
- Business logic encapsulated in service classes  
- Data access through repository pattern
- Dependency injection for testability
- Resource-based REST API design

#### Frontend (Next.js/TypeScript)
- Component composition over inheritance
- Custom hooks for business logic
- Zustand for client state management
- Server components where possible
- Progressive enhancement strategy

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Component tests for UI interactions
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- Manual testing documentation for complex features

## Deployment Optimization

### Current Status
- **‚úÖ COMPLETED**: Docker image optimization (622MB ‚Üí 308MB, 50% reduction)
- **‚ö†Ô∏è COST CONCERN**: Fly.io charges for multiple machines - apps deleted to avoid costs
- **üéØ ACHIEVED**: Multi-stage backend-only build with production optimizations
- **üì¶ Final Image**: 308MB uncompressed, 68MB compressed on registry

### Optimization Strategies Implemented
1. ‚úÖ **Multi-stage Docker builds**: Separate deps, builder, and runtime stages
2. ‚úÖ **Alpine base images**: Using node:22-alpine for minimal footprint
3. ‚úÖ **Dependency pruning**: Production-only deps in runtime stage
4. ‚úÖ **Backend-only focus**: Eliminated frontend from production image
5. ‚úÖ **Security hardening**: Non-root user, dumb-init, proper signals
6. ‚úÖ **Layer optimization**: Efficient copying and caching strategies

### Cost Optimization Notes
- **IMPORTANT**: Fly.io charges per machine - avoid multiple simultaneous deployments
- **Single service deployment**: Current Dockerfile optimized for backend-only
- **Resource settings**: fly.toml configured for 512MB RAM, shared CPU
- **Extended uptime**: Configured with min_machines_running = 1 to prevent auto-sleep
- **Keep-alive monitoring**: Automated health checks every 15 minutes to maintain activity
- **Health checks**: Proper /health endpoint for cost-effective monitoring

### Backend Uptime Management
- **Extended runtime**: Backend configured to run continuously without auto-stop
- **Keep-alive script**: `./scripts/keep-backend-alive.sh` for automated health monitoring
- **Usage**: Run `./scripts/keep-backend-alive.sh continuous` to prevent idle shutdown
- **Monitoring interval**: Health checks every 15 minutes to maintain machine activity
- **Manual check**: Use `./scripts/keep-backend-alive.sh single` for one-time health test

### Future Deployment Strategy
- Use single backend-only deployment for cost efficiency
- Frontend can be deployed separately on free hosting (Vercel, Netlify)
- Consider Railway or Render for potentially lower costs than Fly.io
- Monitor resource usage and scale appropriately
